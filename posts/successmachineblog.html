  					<h2>Description</h2>
  						<p class="blog-section">Per the freeCodeCamp Front-End Certificate curriculum, I created a Random Quote Machine, or in my case, a Success Story Machine. It is a simple generator that provides links to stories about self-taught developers finding jobs. The purpose was to give the project my own twist and build something that others might find useful. </p>
            <h2>Tecnologies Used</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">HTML/CSS, vanillaJS</p>
            <h2>What I struggled with</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">The most difficult part of this project was successfully using the Twitter API. I had troubles figuring out how to change the text content of the Tweet button after the button had already loaded. After hours of struggling, I finally realized the Twitter API wouldn't let you change the text-data within the tweet button after it loaded. </p>
              <p>In order to fix that, I had to use a function they mention in the docs called createShareButton. Now, every time the user clicks the button "Get Success Story", a new tweet button is generated with the link inside. This solved my problem and made it possible to have a button for the user to tweet the story.</p>
              <p>The other problem I ran into was generating the same story twice in a row. In order to prevent this, I had to remove the story from the array so it wouldn't come up twice. This also allowed the user to get all the stories at least once before seeing the same story again.</p>
            <h2>What I learned</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">I learned how to use the Twitter API and how to write a "getter" function. The Twitter API docs didn't have a lot of examples so I had to find outside sources in order to fully understand how everything worked. However, I am now familiar with the API and feel confident in my abilities to use it in future applications.</p>
              <p>During this project, I pair-programmed with a friend who is a Senior Developer who taught me how to write a getter function. He mentioned that the importance of this is encapsulating information into one place: a function. I used this strategy to encapsulate my array of stories.</p>
