  					<h2>Description</h2>
  						<p class="blog-section">This project was part of a course I completed on Udemy called "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. The project was a code-along where he showed you how to connect all the pieces.</p>
            <h2>Tecnologies Used</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">HTML/CSS and Javascript.</p>
            <h2>What I struggled with</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">To be quite honest, I didn't struggle much with this project because everything was straight forward. I had some minor issues with my HTML or Javascript but they were mainly typos or simple mistakes.</p>
            <h2>What I learned</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">This was the first project that made me feel comfortable connecting Javascript to HTML/CSS to make a website interactive. The most exciting part was learning about the <em>transition property</em> in CSS. I always thought you needed JS to create transitions but I find is so awesome that it's built into CSS.</p>
              <p>I also learned how to refactor code to make it look clean and easy to read. The first version of the game didn't look as pretty as it does now. I enjoyed learning how to refactor the code to keep it nice and tidy.</p>
