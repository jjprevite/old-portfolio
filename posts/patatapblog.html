  					<h2>Description</h2>
  						<p class="blog-section">The assignment for the Web Developer Bootcamp was to clone the functionality of the popular website <a href="https://www.patatap.com">Patatap</a>. We followed along with the instructor to create a website that shot different colored circles into the "screen galaxy" along with a unique sound. This happens when the user presses any of the 26 letters keys. The sounds came from the original Patatap project and the library used to create the circles was called PaperJS.</p>
            <h2>Tecnologies Used</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">HTML/CSS, vanillaJS, PaperJS.</p>
            <h2>What I struggled with</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">The hardest part was finding my bugs that prevented my code from running. There were a few times during the code-along where I ran into problems with my code. I had to learn to look at every single character in each line of code to find an extra semi-colon preventing my script from running. This was frustrating in the moment but it taught me to appreciate the struggle that comes along with coding. After I fixed my issues, I felt an immense sense of joy knowing that I had resolved my problems and made my code run successfully.</p>
            <h2>What I learned</h2>
              <p class="blog-section">I learned how to use an external library--PaperJS in this case--in a personal project. By using code written by someone else, I was able to accomplish more on my own by reading the docs and figuring out how to make things function smoothly.</p>
